# Brute Force Attacks
## Instructions

Reports have come in that a major state-sponsored enemy has been conducting
brute force login attempts at many major banking websites. The C levels want
to know if we get attacked, and if it does happen, they want to know ASAP!

## Submission

At some point within the next hour, Red Team will begin brute-force SSH
attacks. As soon as you are able to identify the attack, submit the domain name
of the server targeted as well as the username used for the attempted login.

Points will be awarded based on how quickly you report. No points will be given
for incomplete reports (not containing the user name and host attacked), or
reports misidentifying the attack. The attack will occur during the 1
hour anomaly window.
