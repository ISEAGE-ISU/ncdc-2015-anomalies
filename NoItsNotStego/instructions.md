#It's Not Stego
##Instructions
We found this file on a flash drive left in the parking lot. It's
a pretty large file, so it could be important, but it seems to have been
encrypted.

##Submission
For submission, describe the file. Full points will be awarded
for an accurate description of what the file was before it was encrypted.

Partial points will be awarded for partial descriptions of the file or a
brief description of how you think it may have been encrypted.

The more detailed your submission, the more points you will get, but don't 
just describe the encrypted file. Try to describe what it was before and
what was done to encrypt it. Include details when describing the encryption
process.
