#Promotion Day
##Description
The amount of work that the domain admins are running into at the moment is too much for only two of them. Because of this, we have decided to promote one of our employees to be a new domain admin. John Harker is currently our hardest working employee, and deserves this promotion.
##Directions
Promote John Harker to be a domain admin. As a domain admin, John should be able to SSH into the web server (www.teamN.isucdc.com) and use sudo to add users, change configuration files, install programs, and edit the website. He should also be able to change the password of the day by editing the pass_Administrator file in /usr/lib/db/pass_Administrator.
